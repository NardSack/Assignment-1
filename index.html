        <div class="flexcontainer">
          <div class="left-sidet"><p><CRING>Megurine Luka</CRING> (巡音ルカ), codenamed CV03, is a Japanese VOCALOID developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc., and was initially released in January 2009 for the VOCALOID2 engine. She is the third release of Crypton's Character Vocal Series and is a Character Voice VOCALOID. In March 2015, additional voicebanks and an upgrade to the VOCALOID4 engine were released.

            Her voice is provided by the Japanese voice actress and singer, Yū Asakawa (浅川悠 / Asakawa Yū), who was recorded in Japanese and English for the voicebank. Megurine Luka was the first VOCALOID designed to fully support producing vocals in both Japanese and English, and the first addition to the Character Vocal Series software line characterized as an adult.
            Her surname combines "Meguri" (巡, circulate or around) and "Ne" (音, sound), while the name "Luka" invokes the homophonous pronunciations of 流 (ru, flow), 歌 (ka, song) and 香 (ka, scent), thus making: "songs to all around the world as scent spreads."

            Her name is based on her concept, which is "travelling sound", meaning words which are translated from one language to another.
            
            Her codename of "CV03" means "Character Voice 03".</p></div>

                <div class="right-side"><p><CRING>luz (ルス)</CRING> is an utaite with a voice in the upper register that is somewhat flat and quiet, yet uniquely emotive and expressive. He often covers songs that are emotional or slow, though will sometimes take part in uncharacteristically silly collaborations. His voice has a naturally high timbre, but he has shown himself to be capable of going very low as well. However, his cover of "Ifuudoudou"Nv.gif was a turning point where he began to be known for the erotic quality of his covers rather than the "lazy cuteness" that he was known for in his early days.

                  In his collab with Piko in "Isshinfuran"Nv.gif, it's shown he can rap.
                  
                  He started out at first on Nico Nico Douga in July 2010 as a namahousou personality, best known for his imitations of Gintama characters Sakata Gintoki and Okita Sougo. However, since he held the occasional singing namahousou, listeners began to encourage him to expand into utaite activity, leading him to use an interface for the first time and post a cover of "1925"Nv.gif in October of 2010.
                  
                  
                  Luz is half Japanese. His Father is Japanese and his Mother is Filipino and German-American.</p></div></div>
