  luz (ルス) is an utaite with a voice in the upper register that is somewhat flat and quiet, yet uniquely emotive and expressive. He often covers songs that are emotional or slow, though will sometimes take part in uncharacteristically silly collaborations. His voice has a naturally high timbre, but he has shown himself to be capable of going very low as well. However, his cover of "Ifuudoudou"Nv.gif was a turning point where he began to be known for the erotic quality of his covers rather than the "lazy cuteness" that he was known for in his early days.

    In his collab with Piko in "Isshinfuran"Nv.gif, it's shown he can rap.
    
    He started out at first on Nico Nico Douga in July 2010 as a namahousou personality, best known for his imitations of Gintama characters Sakata Gintoki and Okita Sougo. However, since he held the occasional singing namahousou, listeners began to encourage him to expand into utaite activity, leading him to use an interface for the first time and post a cover of "1925"Nv.gif in October of 2010.
    
    
    Luz is half Japanese. His Father is Japanese and his Mother is Filipino and German-American.</p></div></div>
